
So I've had the wireframe for this particular design kicking around for some time, but with all
the other interesting (and in some cases, semi-secret) projects I've been working on it took me
a little while to get to actually designing and coding it. Fortunately, things have eased up
enough for me to finaly get around to it, so I'm happy to introduce my personal portfolio website!
